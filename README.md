# Health-Disease-Prediction-using-R-Programming

The creation of a heart prediction system is the main goal of this study. The algorithm can find and extract disease-related hidden knowledge from a historical heart data set. To aid in the prediction of heart disorders, the heart disease prediction system uses data mining techniques on a set of medical data.
1)	To determine the importance of important traits in predicting heart disease.
2)	Using the estimated weight of relevant features to forecast heart disease (using ML algorithms) to assess accuracy in predicting heart disease.
3)	Offers a fresh perspective on hidden patterns in the data.
4)	Helps avoid human biasness.

We used regression algorithms, Random Forest algorithm, SVM in this system to develop an efficient heart attack prediction system. The system can receive input from a UCI Heart CSV file.
