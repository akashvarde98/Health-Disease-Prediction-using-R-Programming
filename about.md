1) What is BMI?

   Body Mass Index (BMI)** is essentially a value obtained from the weight and height of a person [1].

2) Calculating the BMI

   BMI can be computed by dividing the person's weight (kg) by their squared height (m) as follows:

   BMI = kg/m^2

   where *kg* represents the person's weight and *m^2* the person's squared height.

3) About this BMI Calculator

   This *BMI Calculator* is for adults 20 years and older. Further information on calculating BMI for children and teenagers is available from the CDC [2].

4) BMI is a good indicator of heart disease

   A ratio of weight to height proved to be a bust for predicting death from heart disease in an analysis of 40 previously reported studies involving 250,000 patients with heart disease followed for an average of four years.

   The low-weight patients in the studies those with the lowest BMIs -- had the highest rates of death from heart disease and all other causes. Patients considered to be overweight, but not obese, had lower risk for death from any cause than patients whose BMIs fell in the normal range.

   i) Try to lose weight (if overweight) or control weight. 
   “That’s one of the best strategies we now know of to reduce heart failure down the road,” Ndumele says.

   ii) Know your heart disease risk. 
   It’s smart to have your heart risk assessed and “know your numbers” (BMI, blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol).

   iii) If you’re obese, be watchful for signs of heart failure. 
   These include fatigue, shortness of breath and an irregular heartbeat.

   iv) Realize that all weight loss helps.
   For every five-point increase in BMI, the risk of heart failure rose by 32 percent in the study.
